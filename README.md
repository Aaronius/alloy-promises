This is a repository I use when training about promises as they related to [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://github.com/adobe/alloy) JavaScript library.

The repository is broken down into separate HTML files that build on each other.

* `step1.html` - Demonstrates executing Alloy commands and handling their results.
* `step2.html` - The same as `step1.html` except with console logging cleaned up and more short-hand being used. This is more likely what you'll see in customer implementations.
* `step3.html` - Attempts to use an unsupported Alloy command (named `bogus`) and demonstrates how to handle the resulting error.
